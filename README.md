I am a Software Quality Assurance Analyst | Business Analyst Enthusiast

I’m a detail-oriented and motivated Software Tester with hands-on experience in functional testing, software quality assurance, API testing, and test automation. I thrive on identifying and resolving software issues to enhance user experience and system reliability. My passion for software quality goes beyond just testing—I enjoy understanding how systems work, analyzing user needs, and contributing to solutions that make a real impact.

I love bridging the gap between technical teams and business goals, ensuring that software solutions align with user needs and organizational objectives. My background in software testing gives me a strong foundation in problem-solving and attention to detail, which I believe are essential skills for a business analyst.
